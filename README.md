# Distributed-system-Back-End-Server

For a large-scale super market, it is very difficult to maintain the daily business processes. Because if we take like Cargillâ€™s food city, their business process is very complex and  difficult to maintain manually. Therefore we implemented stock and sales management system. By using this system, we can manage the daily point of sales, stock management, profit calculation ,etc. And also it will suitable for large scale grocery store or an super market. User friendly interface every one can easily understand the system working process.
